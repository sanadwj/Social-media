##  Social Media Website

We built a social media app called “Stay in touch”. In this project, we add the following features:

A guest user:

* Is able to create account/log in.
* Can see only “Sign in” and “Sign out” page.

A logged-in user:

* Is able to see all users list.
* Is able to see selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top).
* Is able to send a friendship invitation.
* Is able to see a button “Invite to friendship” next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users’ list and single user page.
* Is able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.
* Is able to accept or reject friendships invitation.
* Is able to create new posts (text only).
* Is able to like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once).
* Is able to add comments to posts.
* Is able to see “Timeline” page with posts (with number of likes and comments) written by me and all my friends (the most recent posts on the top).
* Timeline page should be the root page of the app.
